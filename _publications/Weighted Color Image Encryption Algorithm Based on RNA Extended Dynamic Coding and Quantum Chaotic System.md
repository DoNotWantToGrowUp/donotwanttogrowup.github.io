The rapid development of Internet technology, while providing convenient services for users, has also aroused deep concern among the public about the issue of privacy leakage during image data transmission. To address this situation, this article proposes a color image encryption algorithm based on RNA extended dynamic coding and quantum chaos (CIEA-RQ). This algorithm significantly improves the ability of the system to withstand cryptographic attacks by introducing RNA extended dynamic encoding with 384 encoding rules. The employed quantum chaotic map improves the randomness of chaotic sequences and increases the key space. First, the algorithm decomposes the plaintext image into bit planes and obtains two parts, high 4-bit and low 4-bit planes, based on different weights of information. Then, the high 4-bit planes are partitioned into blocks and scrambled, and the scrambled planes are confused using RNA extended coding rules. Meanwhile, the low 4-bit planes employ a lightweight XOR operation to improve encryption efficiency. Finally, the algorithm performs cross-iterative diffusion on the processed high 4-bit and low 4-bit planes and then synthesizes a color ciphertext image. Experimental simulations and security assessments demonstrate the superior numerical statistical outcomes of the CIEA-RQ. According to the criteria of cryptanalysis, it can effectively resist known-plaintext attacks and chosen-plaintext attacks. Therefore, the CIEA-RQ presented in this article serves as an efficient digital image privacy safeguard technique, promising extensive applications in image secure transmission for the upcoming generation of networks.
