With the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence, the problem of image privacy leakage has become increasingly prominent, especially for images containing sensitive information such as faces, which poses a higher security risk. In order to improve the security and efficiency of image privacy protection, this paper proposes an image encryption scheme that integrates face detection and multi-level encryption technology. Specifically, a multi-task convolutional neural network (MTCNN) is used to accurately extract the face area to ensure accurate positioning and high processing efficiency. For the extracted face area, a hierarchical encryption framework is constructed using chaotic systems, lightweight block permutations, RNA cryptographic systems, and bit diffusion, which increases data complexity and unpredictability. In addition, a key update mechanism based on dynamic feedback is introduced to enable the key to change in real time during the encryption process, effectively resisting known plaintext and chosen plaintext attacks. Experimental results show that the scheme performs well in terms of encryption security, robustness, computational efficiency, and image reconstruction quality. This study provides a practical and effective solution for the secure storage and transmission of sensitive face images, and provides valuable support for image privacy protection in intelligent systems.
