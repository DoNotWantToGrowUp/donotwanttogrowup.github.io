Here is **Yiting Lin（林一挺）**.
I am currently a research assistant at Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University (BNBU), advised by [A.P. Donglong CHEN](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/donglongchen/en), within Guangdong Provincial/Zhuhai Key Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Research and Application for Data Science. I am also a teacher (Teaching and Research Position/Research Assistant) in [Prof. Wenbin Cheng](https://jsjxy.zsc.edu.cn/szdw/szdwzg/1dje8dg8bfln5.shtml)'s postgraduate research team at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Zhongshan Institute. I have published over 20 papers since 2022, including 3 papers from the first quartile journals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have authored 9 highly cited papers according to the Essential Science Indicators (ESI), and 3 hot paper according to the ESI. I have served as a peer reviewer for prestigious journals including IEEE TIFS, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TSMC-S, IEEE TCAS-I, IEEE TBD, IEEE TII, IEEE IOTJ, ACM TOMM, etc., as well as for publications by  academic publishers such as Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, IOP Publishing, Taylor&Francis, MDPI, etc.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - YitingLin [at] ieee.org

## Research Interests

- Cryptography
- Blockchain
- Information Security 
- Multimedia Security
- Artificial Intelligence (ML/DL)

My current research focuses on the practical problems faced by the intersection of cryptography and other disciplines in real-life applications. My interests are blockchain and fully homomorphic encryption and their applications in industrial IoT and life. My research also involves some areas of artificial intelligence. In short, advanced technologies such as cryptography, artificial intelligence, and the Internet have a positive impact on everyone's life. I hope to devote my talents to this meaningful cause and bring benefits to society.
